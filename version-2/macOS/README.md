# Installation on a Mac

1) Install Karabiner-Elements.
2) Copy the contents of `dvorak_booster_karabiner_ascii_cmd_qwerty_v2.1.0.json` Note: this version is designed to work with what Apple calls "British-PC" layout i.e. British English ISO keyboard layout. But you can make adjustments for other layouts. (Read the descriptions to understand how it works.)
3) Paste the contents in Karabiner-Elements under **Complex Modifications**. 
4) Done.

This will enable the Dvorak-Booster layout (except dead keys).  
But when pressing the *left command* key (or left command + Shift), it will revert to the regular QWERTY layout. So, all the usual shortcuts like Cmd+C, Cmd+V etc. should work the same way as before.  
Holding down the *right command* key enables the AltGr layer. And right command + Shift enables the AltGr+Shift layer. And the right option key will function as the CapsLock key.

After thorough testing, you can also, under "Misc" click "*Copy the current configuration to the system default configuration*". But do this ONLY after thorough testing and restarting a few times.
