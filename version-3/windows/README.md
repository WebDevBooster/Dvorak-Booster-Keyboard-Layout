**KbdEdit Premium** is the program I used for editing the keymaps on Windows. Because the software released by Microsoft for this purpose lacks functionality. 

To install this keyboard layout on Windows, run  
KbdEditInstaller_Dvorak-Booster_v3.1.4.exe  
or whatever the latest version is.

For importing this layout into **KbdEdit Premium**  
run **KbdEdit Premium** as administrator and  
then import  
Dvorak-Booster v3.1.4.kbe  
or whatever the latest version is. 

See the images folder for screenshots of different levels.
