Version 1 was created before I was using git. 

Also, I was using the klm2000 software for generating the dll files for Windows. 

That software (klm2000) doesn't seem to be maintained anymore. Also, the dll files it generates are no longer working with the newest versions of Windows 10. 

So, I'm switching to `KbdEdit` for now.
