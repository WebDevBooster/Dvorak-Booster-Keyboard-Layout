Version 1 was created before I was using git. 

Also, I was using the klm2000 software for generating the dll files for Windows. 

That software (klm2000) doesn't seem to be maintained anymore. Also, the dll files it generates are no longer working with the newest versions of Windows 10. 

So, I'm switching to `KbdEdit` for now.

The "M" keys on the layout images (M1, M2, M3 etc.) refer to the **modifier** keys. 

The modifier keys are usually dead keys i.e. they require a second key to be pressed for an output to be triggered. 

There are also **ligatures** in use.  
So, holding the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> key pressed and then pressing the dash (<kbd>-</kbd>) key will result in what's in programming known as a "fat arrow" (=>) followed by a space.
