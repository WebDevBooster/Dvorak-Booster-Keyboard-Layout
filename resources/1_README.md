This folder is for collecting general resources and ideas

Some HTML pages have been saved in their entirety. So, they can be viewed in the browser exactly as I found them (even if those page contents change later or disappear etc).

### Important to note: 

**None of the content in this 'resources' folder belongs to me.** It is merely just content I collected on the internet (prior to starting this repo).

In the future, I'm just gonna be posting the links to the relevant pages and/or quote the relevant content here.
