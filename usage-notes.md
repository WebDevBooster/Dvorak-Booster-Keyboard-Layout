# Usage Notes

In the `images` folder, you'll find the screenshots for different levels. 

### Default 

`default` is the lower case letters state. The fingers of the left hand rest on the 4 keys of the home row (`aoei` in this keyboard layout which corresponds to `asdf` in the QWERTY layout). And the fingers of the right hand rest on the other 4 keys of the home row (`htns` in this layout corresponding with `jkl;` in the QWERTY layout). 

The TAB key (`HT` in this screenshot) remains where it was in the QWERTY layout. The capslock key has been replaced with the semicolon (which is often used in many programming languages). Capslock itself has been moved to the PrintScreen key i.e. the key that's immediately right of the `AltGr` key. The key above the TAB key is the right arrow key. The key on the right of the TAB key is the left arrow key. 

As explained on the main [ReadMe](README.md), the numbers on the numbers row are positioned based on the frequency of their use. Most frequently used number like `1` and `0` are in the center because the center of the numbers row is the easiest to reach. Odd numbers are on the left and even numbers are on the right. The dozenal single digit numbers `el` and `dek` are also on the numbers row.

### CTRL + key defaults to QWERTY

When the control key is pressed, the layout reverts to QWERTY. So, shortcuts like `CTRL + C`, `CTRL + V` etc. continue to work the same way as on the QWERTY layout. That's why changing the key labels isn't necessary. 

### SHIFT key (level 2)

As expected, when the SHIFT key is pressed, you get upper case letters. 

Additionally, on the numbers row you get various accent marks used in many different languages. So, to type a German umlaut like ü, ö or ä, you hold the SHIFT key pressed, then press the dots key on the numbers row (corresponds with the key for number 3 in this layout) and then type the letter that you want to add the umlaut to. 

To type the Spanish ñ, you hold the SHIFT key and press the key that corresponds with the number 9 in this layout followed by the letter n. Same thing for all other accented letters. 

The special character keys above the home row are for the inverted bang and the inverted question mark as well as the cedilla.

### AltGr key (level 3)

While this is technially level 3, I consider this to be level 2 because pressing the AltGr key (that's on the right of the space bar) is much easier and more pleasant than pressing the Shift key. Pressing the AltGr (and keeping it pressed) with the right thumb is almost completely effortless! 

Also, the special characters accessed by pressing the AltGr key are used much more frequently in programming than the upper case letters in English. The most frequently used special characters for programming are directly on the home row! The special characters that are frequently used in programming are a million times easier to type with this layout. (because holding the AltGr key with the right thumb takes almost no effort)

As mentioned before, the capslock (for typing strings in UPPERCASE) is on the right of the AltGr key.

### AltGr + Shift key (level 4)

Level 4 is accessed by pressing down and holding both the AltGr and the Shift key. This is an awkward thing to do. So, only the least frequently used characters have been placed on this level.

Below is an overview that could be used for printing labels although I don't recommend re-labeling the keyboard because it reverts to QWERTY when the `CTRL` is pressed.
