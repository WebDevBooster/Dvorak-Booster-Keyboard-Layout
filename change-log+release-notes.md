# Change Log & Release Notes of the Dvorak-Booster Keyboard Layout

3.1.4 (updated on 15 July 2023)

Updated the `KbdEditInstaller_Dvorak-Booster_v3.1.4.exe` and the `Dvorak-Booster v3.1.4.kbe` files for this version because the inverted exclamation mark `ยก` was a lower case `i` by mistake.

3.1.4 (released in June 2022) 

After many tweaks and iterations it finally occurred to me that I should add a change log here. :-) 

That version 3.1.4 was tweaked and developed based on the real-world use. I believe this refined version is finally ready for a public release. 

This version not only makes typing in English much easier than the standard QWERTY layout, in also makes the life of a programmer a breeze. Because all the special characters a coder needs are a million times easier and faster to reach than with the standard QWERTY layout. 

Additionally, this version makes it possible to type in ANY European language (that's based on the Latin Alphabet) ***without*** the need to change the keyboard layout. 

The Dvorak-Booster layout is **optimized for English** because a keyboard layout can only be optimized for ONE language. But it is **possible** to use this layout for typing in any Latin Alphabet-based language like German, French, Spanish, Portuguese etc.
