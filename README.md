# Dvorak-Booster-Keyboard-Layout
The Dvorak-Booster keyboard layout is better optimized for typing in English than standard Dvorak and better optimized for programming than Programmer Dvorak. It also makes it easy to type in the dozenal (base 12) system and the layout of numbers is optimized according to their frequency (unlike standard Dvorak and Programmer Dvorak). The Dvorak-Booster layout also makes it possible to type in any European (Latin-based) language without switching the keyboard layout.
