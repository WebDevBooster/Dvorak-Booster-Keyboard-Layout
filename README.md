# Dvorak-Booster Keyboard Layout

The Dvorak-Booster keyboard layout is better optimized for typing in English than standard Dvorak and better optimized for programming than Programmer Dvorak. 

It also makes it easy to type in the dozenal (base 12) system and the layout of numbers is optimized according to their frequency (unlike standard Dvorak and Programmer Dvorak). 

The Dvorak-Booster layout also makes it possible to type in any European (Latin-based) language without switching the keyboard layout.

## How and Why

When I originally learned to touch type, 
I initially did a research before learning 
(because I like to do things thoroughly) 
and I quickly realized that the standard keyboard layout i.e. the keyboard layout used on **all standard computer keyboards** today 
was actually developed, **specifically developed to SLOW DOWN TYPING!** 

Hard to believe but it's true.  
The standard keyboard layout that's being used for computers today is the same that was originally developed for **mechanical typewriters**. 

It was developed to solve a common and very annoying problem with mechanical typewriters:  
The levers for the letters (each letter was attached to an individual mechanical lever) 
would often interlock if you typed too fast. 

I have actually experienced this problem first hand (a very long time ago) when I tried to type on a mechanical typewriter. While I wasn't typing fast, occasionally I would press two adjacent keys together by accident... 

And every time that happened, it was a very annoying and time consuming mess. Getting those levers unstuck wasn't easy and you had to get your fingers dirty etc. etc. It was a mess. 

Long story short, the original (standard) keyboard layouts (for each language) were **specifically developed to slow down typists** in order to minimize those occasions where the typing levers would interlock and get stuck. Typist was actually a profession and companies used to employ large numbers of people whose sole job was to type all day, transcribe from audio recordings etc.

And when computers and computer keyboards got invented (without any mechanical levers attached to the keys), the same old keyboard layouts were copied unchanged. 

Once I learned this simple fact, there was NO way I would learn this standard keyboard layout that was designed for SLOW typing. 

So, I learned a keyboard layout that was actually... 

* optimized for typing on a computer
* optimized for typing fast
* optimized for being easy on the hands and wrists

That keyboard layout was [**Dvorak**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout).

Dvorak was the first keyboard layout designed and optimized specifically for making typing easier and faster. 

In other words, Dvorak was the first **sane** keyboard layout for computers. Using the mechanical typewriter layout for computer keyboards is idiotic and insane. And not telling people who want to learn touch typing, not telling them the truth about the 150-year old mechanical typewriter layout is gross negligence. 

There were just 2 problems with the Dvorak layout for typing standard English texts: 

1) For reasons unknown to me the "i" key and the "u" key aren't positioned according to their frequency on the Dvorak layout.  
They have to be swapped because the letter "i" is much more common in English than the letter "u". Therefore the letter "i" must be mapped to one of the "resting position" keys on the keyboard. The most logical way to correct this mistake by August Dvorak (the creator of the original Dvorak layout) is to swap the positions of the "u" and the "i" keys.

2) The numbers (on the number row) aren't positioned in accordance to their frequency in normal English texts. So, the most frequently used numbers (0 and 1) are still hard to reach and thus harder to type on a Dvorak layout. Of course, numbers aren't used as often in normal English texts. This might have been the reason why August Dvorak had neglected the numbers row.

But numbers are used a lot in programming. Which brings us to the next point: 

The standard Dvorak layout isn't designed for programming. 

This is why the [**Programmer Dvorak**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout#Programmer_Dvorak) version was developed. 

BUT:  
While Programmer Dvorak is much more programmer-friendly, in my opinion, Programmer Dvorak is what I would call a "half-assed" effort.

### Why do something in a half-assed way if you can do it right?

I really don't have an answer to that question.  
It's always been a mystery to me why people do that. 

So: 

The Dvorak-Booster keyboard layout is merely just my attempt to "do things right". 

**I hate doing things in a half-assed way.  
I like doing things right.** 


This is WHY I have developed this keyboard layout that I named Dvorak-Booster.

#### I just want a keyboard layout that's done RIGHT! 

That's all there's to it! 

Just a keyboard layout where everything's done right. 

No more, no less. 

It' a very simple idea. 

Why can't we have a keyboard layout...  
just one keyboard layout where everything is done right??? 

Why do we have to bend and break our fingers and break our wrists? 

Why can't we just have a keyboard layout that's really **super pleasant** for typing in English and for programming as well??

This is just BEYOND my understanding. 

And this is why I decided to get it done myself. 


## Layout Rationale

Yes, I realize that if you're already used to the standard Dvorak layout (as I was), then for the next 2 and a half days (or maybe even for 3 entire days) you'll be very annoyed because the "u" and the "i" keys are swapped here. But once you get used to it (after 3 solid days of usage), you'll never look back! I promise. 

3 days is the sacrifice that you'll need to bring if you're coming from standard Dvorak. 
People coming from QUERTY will need to sacrifice 5 days. Imagine that! 

But hey! Sometimes, in life, you have to sacrifice an old, fat, lame donkey if you want to gain a young, fresh, slender racing horse... 

Nothing's free in this life.  
Except for free software, of course.
